# Experience Asset Hierarchy

```
experience/
  full-time/<slug>/image-1.svg
  freelance/<project>/image-1.svg
```

- Follow the same sequential naming rules (`image-1`, `image-2`, ...).
- Use lowercase, hyphenated slugs so they match the data files.
- Keep assets optimized (SVG/WEBP preferred) and anonymize sensitive data.
